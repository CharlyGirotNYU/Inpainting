Titre : Fast Digital Image Inpainting

Simple and fast inpainting algo based on an isotropic diffusion model extented with the notion of user-provided diffusion barriers

Technique / Algo  : 
Repeatedly convolving the region to be inpainted with a diffusion kernel

Pseudo Code for the fast inpainting algorithm :
- init region to be inpainted Sig
- for (iter=0 ; iter < num_iter ; iter++)
	convolve = masked regions with kernel;

Two diffusion kernel with a = 0.073235, b =0.176765, c=0.125
a b a     c c c 
b 0 b     c 0 c 
a b a     c c c 

Avantage de la méthode / Cas d'utilisation / Limitations : 

The regions to be inpainted must be locally small 
Two or three times faster than previous work and comparable to previous results 
Sig must be exactly the size of the region to be reconstructed 
For larger inpainting domains a scale-space approach can be used to preserve the algorithm's speed at the expense of reconstruction quality

Measures of execution times and MSE for RGB channels of the restored images provided
