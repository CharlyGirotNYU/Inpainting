Titre : Simultaneous Structure and texture Image Inpainting

Simultanoeous filling in of texture and structure in tegions of missing image information
Decompose the image into the sum of two functions then reconstruct each one of these functions with separately with structure and texture filling--in algorithms. Then added back together.

Technique / Algo  : 
decomposition technique : 
Decomposition by total variation minimization and the space of oscillationg functions
Minimization problem in the space of functions of Bounded Variations BV

Texture SYnthesis technique :
ImageInpainting technique : solving PDE 


Avantage de la méthode / Cas d'utilisation / Limitations : 
Since a number of algorithms exists for each one of these three components, the combination that provides the best visual results is an interesting experimental and theoretical research topic

Possible extension to video and 3D data.
